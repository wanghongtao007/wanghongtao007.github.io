Istio Book Info 

Public reference implementation for Istio

Documentation:  https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo.html 
Instructions:
Environment Prep:
1.	Using inspiration from the steps found on the Istio installation guide to configure Istio locally. Be sure to set the ISTIO_HOME environment variable to the location where Istio was downloaded locally.

export ISTIO_HOME=<path_to_istio_home>

It is recommended that this value be stored in a user profile (~/.bashrc)

2.	Configure OpenShift policies

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z istio-ingress-service-account -n istio-system
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z istio-egress-service-account -n istio-system
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z istio-pilot-service-account -n istio-system
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n istio-system

3.	Install Istio

oc apply -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/install/kubernetes/istio.yaml

Application Deployment:
1.	Create a project for Book Info

oc new-project bookinfo

2.	Add the default service account the privileged SCC

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n bookinfo

3.	Using the manual sidecar injection method, deploy the application

oc apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/bookinfo.yaml)


An OpenShift Route or Istio Ingress can be used to access resources within OpenShift. This guide provides both mechanisms and will utilize the variable GATEWAY_URL as a way that each can be used interchangeably. 

OpenShift Routes

One of the resources created in the previous command was a Istio ingress. The defined settings can be replicated using OpenShift routes. Execute the following commands to expose the productpage service and create routes aligning to different paths exposed. 

Note: You will need to provide the default subdomain for your cluster

1.	Create the routes by exposing the services

oc expose svc productpage --name=productpage --path=/productpage --hostname=productpage-bookinfo.${DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN}
oc expose svc productpage --name=productpage-login --path=/login --hostname=productpage-bookinfo.${DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN}


2.	Set the GATEWAY_URL value

GATEWAY_URL=$(oc get routes productpage -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')

Istio Ingress

1.	Set the GATEWAY_URL to be the address of the Istio ingress controller by querying the 

GATEWAY_URL=$(oc get -n istio-system pod -l istio=ingress -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}'):$(oc get -n istio-system svc istio-ingress -o 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')



At this point, depending on the method for accessing resources within the cluster, you should be able to view the Product Page in a browser by visiting the value found in GATEWAY_URL. 

echo http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage

Intelligent Routing:

This section covers the Traffic Management Capabilities as described here

Request Routing

1.	Set default version for all microservices to v1

oc create -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-all-v1.yaml


2.	Display rules

oc get routerules -o yaml

3.	Open http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage in a browser

4.	Route a specific user to v2

oc create -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml

5.	Confirm the rule was created

oc get routerule reviews-test-v2 -o yaml

6.	Login as “json” to see ratings stars next to each review

7.	Cleanup the resources (Can skip if proceeding to next section)

oc delete -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-all-v1.yaml
oc delete -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml

Fault Injection

1.	Create resources from Request Routing demo above (Can skip if necessary)

oc create -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-all-v1.yaml
oc create -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml

2.	Route fault injection rule

oc create -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-ratings-test-delay.yaml

3.	Confirm the rule was created

oc get routerule ratings-test-delay -o yaml

4.	Observe application behavior

5.	Logout as user Jason and cleanup the resources (Can skip if proceeding to next section)

oc delete -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-all-v1.yaml
oc delete -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml
oc delete -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-ratings-test-delay.yaml

Traffic Shifting

1.	Set all microservices to v1

oc create -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-all-v1.yaml

2.	Confirm v1 is active by browsing to http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage

3.	Transfer 50% of the traffic from reviews:v1 to reviews:v3

oc replace -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-50-v3.yaml

4.	Refresh product page to see changes

5.	Route 100% of the traffic to reviews:v3

oc replace -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-reviews-v3.yaml

6.	Login as any user to see red stars for each review

7.	Cleanup resources

oc delete -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/samples/bookinfo/kube/route-rule-all-v1.yaml

Intelligent Routing:

This section covers how to obtain metrics across the different Istio services as described here

1.	Change to the istio-system project

oc project istio-system


2.	Deploy Prometheus

oc apply -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/install/kubernetes/addons/prometheus.yaml

3.	Expose the service as a route

oc expose svc prometheus

4.	Create the new_telemetry.yml file as shown 

vi new_telemetry.yml

5.	Deploy telemetry to OpenShift 

oc create -f new_telemetry.yml


6.	Visit the Product Page in a web browser or execute a few curl commands 

curl http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage


7.	Navigate to Prometheus in a web browser

http://prometheus-istio-system.${DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN}

8.	Search for double_request_count in the Prometheus UI
 
9.	Verify log streams have been produced

oc -n istio-system logs $(oc -n istio-system get pods -l istio=mixer -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -c mixer | grep \"instance\":\"newlog.logentry.istio-system\"

10.	Cleanup 

oc delete -f new_telemetry.yml
rm new_telemetry.yml

Querying Metrics:

This section describes how to query metrics using many of the same skills as described in the previous section. Since Prometheus is still active, you are free to query the statistics against the existing server using the steps provided.

Distributed Tracing:

1.	Deploy Jager 

oc project istio-system
oc apply -n istio-system -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-kubernetes/master/all-in-one/jaeger-all-in-one-template.yml


2.	Expose Jaeger to create a service and a route 

oc expose -n istio-system deployment jaeger-deployment --name=jaeger --port=16686
oc expose svc jaeger


3.	Navigate to Jaeger in a web browser 

http://jaeger-istio-system.${DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN}


4.	Navigate to Jaeger in a web browser and browse around the available tracing data

5.	Remove Jager 

oc delete -n istio-system -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-kubernetes/master/all-in-one/jaeger-all-in-one-template.yml


Using the Istio Dashboard:

This section describes how to query metrics using many of the same skills as described in the previous section. Since Prometheus is still active, you are free to query the statistics against the existing server using the steps provided.

1.	Deploy Grafana 

oc project istio-system
oc apply -n istio-system -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/install/kubernetes/addons/grafana.yaml

2.	Expose the Grafana Service

oc expose svc grafana

3.	Navigate to Grafana in a web browser

http://grafana-istio-system.${DEFAULT_SUBDOMAIN}

4.	Utilize the grafana dashboard

5.	Cleanup Grafana as described

oc delete -n istio-system -f ${ISTIO_HOME}/install/kubernetes/addons/grafana.yaml
